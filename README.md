- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlekseiSaunders
- 👀 I’m interested in transitioning to a job as a fullstack web developer and data analyst. But also beer, birds, and building kayaks. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, well, as much as I can... HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, SQL, MongoDB, Python, how to use an ErgoDox keyboard..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can build and cement these skills, especially environmental projects involving conservation or habitat monitoring.
- 📫 How to reach me alekseisaunders@gmail.com.
